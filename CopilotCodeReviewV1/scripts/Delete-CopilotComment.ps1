.SYNOPSIS
    Deletes a comment from a pull request thread in Azure DevOps.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script is used by GitHub Copilot to delete previously-created comments.
    It can delete individual comments within a thread. Note that deleting all comments
    in a thread does not delete the thread itself. The script is designed to fail
    silently to avoid blocking the code review process.

.PARAMETER ThreadId
    Required. The ID of the thread containing the comment.

.PARAMETER CommentId
    Required. The ID of the comment to delete.

.EXAMPLE
    .\Delete-CopilotComment.ps1 -ThreadId 123 -CommentId 456
    Deletes comment #456 from thread #123.

    Requires: PowerShell 5.1 or later
    
    Environment Variables Used:
    - AZUREDEVOPS_TOKEN: Authentication token (PAT or OAuth)
    - AZUREDEVOPS_AUTH_TYPE: 'Basic' for PAT, 'Bearer' for OAuth
    - ORGANIZATION: Azure DevOps organization name
    - PROJECT: Azure DevOps project name
    - REPOSITORY: Repository name
    - PRID: Pull request ID
    
    This script fails silently by design. Errors are suppressed to avoid
    interrupting the Copilot review workflow.
    
    Important: You can only delete comments that were created by the same identity
    (Build Service or PAT user) making the delete request.
