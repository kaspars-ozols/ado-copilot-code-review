# Extension Icon

The Azure DevOps marketplace requires a PNG icon (minimum 128x128 pixels).

## Current Status

A placeholder SVG (`extension-icon.svg`) has been created. Before publishing to the marketplace, you need to:

1. Either convert the SVG to PNG:
   - Use any image editor or online converter
   - Export as 128x128 PNG (minimum) or larger
   - Save as `extension-icon.png`

2. Or replace with your own custom icon:
   - Create a PNG image (minimum 128x128 pixels)
   - Save as `extension-icon.png` in this folder

## Recommended Icon Sizes

- Minimum: 128x128 pixels
- Recommended: 256x256 pixels for better quality on high-DPI displays

## Icon Guidelines

- Use simple, recognizable imagery
- Ensure good contrast for visibility
- Consider how it looks at small sizes
- Follow Azure DevOps marketplace branding guidelines
